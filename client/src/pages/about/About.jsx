      Araz Saydu,
      was born in Syria, Qamishli.
      It all started when i wanted to create a portfolio for me and write there  some thoughts.
      So i built one on Google Blogger and tried to improve it.
      i should learn HTML and CSS to that.
      because there was no internet permanently I did'nt learn a lot.
      then i found out  I should learn something mre advanced so I began to learn PHP after
       a while I come to Germany and started to learn German so I did!
       I saw I need to learn something else so I began to learn JAVA on YOUTUBE and UDEMY and
       visited a course at ReDI-School. I did'nt find myself excited to learn JAVA.
       I searched for something makes me excited and I would love to learn and do it I chose JAVASCRIPT.
       I applied for a Full Stack Web developer course at DCI - Digital Career Institute gGmbH.
       I did the course successfully.
       I did the final project and was satisfied with myself.
       I learned a lot and I know now I should keeping learning.
       This field is the field for people who are excited to learn and learn every day and I'm like that.
